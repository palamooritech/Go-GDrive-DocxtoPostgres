# go-gdrive

##Introduction
This is a personal application written in golang to take all the ".docx/pdf"
files in my work's g-drive folder. This fetches all the details, including the summaries of the .docx files.

This is my attempt at crossing the amatuer programmer barrier. Please do give me a feed back.
